`gulp images` command copies the optimized images to the `dist/content`.

`clean` task fully completes before the `scripts`, `styles`, and `images` tasks are ran.

`gulp scripts` command generates JavaScript source maps.

`gulp styles` command compiles the project‚Äôs SCSS files into CSS, and concatenates and minifies into an `all.min.css` file in `dist/styles`.

`gulp styles` command generates CSS source maps.

`gulp` command properly runs the `build` task as a dependency.

`gulp` command serves the project using a local webserver
